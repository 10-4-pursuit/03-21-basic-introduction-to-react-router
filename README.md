# Exercise 2: Basic Introduction to React Router

## Objective
Learn the fundamentals of routing in a React application using React Router, including setting up routes and creating navigational links.

## Setup

1. **Create an 'Exercises' Directory** (If not already done):
   - If you haven't already, create a main directory on your local machine to house all your exercises. You can do this using `mkdir Exercises`.

2. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Navigate to the GitHub repository for this exercise at `03-21-basic-introduction-to-react-router`.
   - Click on the 'Fork' button to create a fork of the repository.

3. **Clone Your Forked Repository**:
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to your `Exercises` directory using `cd path/to/Exercises`.
   - Run `git clone <your-forked-repo-url>` to clone the repository to your machine.
   - This will create a new directory named `03-21-basic-introduction-to-react-router` under `Exercises`.

4. **Initial Setup**:
   - The repository already includes the skeleton code generated by Create React App.
   - Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd 03-21-basic-introduction-to-react-router`.
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies, including React Router.
   - Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Exercise Instructions

1. **Install React Router**:
   - Use `npm install react-router-dom` to add React Router to your project.

2. **Setup Routing in Your Application**:
   - In `App.js`, import `BrowserRouter` as `Router`, `Route`, and `Link` from `react-router-dom`.
   - Use the `Router` component to wrap your application's main components.
   - Create a navigation bar with `Link` components for 'Home' and 'About' paths.

3. **Implementing Routes and Components**:
   - Use `Route` to define two paths: '/' (Home) and '/about' (About).
   - For the `Home` component:
     - Display a message like "Welcome to the Home Page".
     - Add an image that fits a home or welcoming theme.
   - For the `About` component:
     - Explain in your own words how routing works in React Router. Write this as an ordered list describing the steps that happen when a user navigates to the 'About' page.
     - Cover key points like how the URL matches the route and how the `About` component is displayed as a result.

4. **Testing Your Routes**:
   - Test that clicking the navigation links changes the URL and shows the correct component without reloading the page.
   - Make sure both `Home` and `About` components show the content you added as per the instructions.

## Submission

1. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - After completing the exercise, ensure all your changes are saved.
   - Run `git add .` to stage your changes.
   - Run `git commit -m "Completed Basic Introduction to React Router"` to commit your changes.

2. **Push to Your Fork**:
   - Run `git push` to push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

3. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on 'Pull Request' to create a new pull request to the original repository.
   - Ensure the pull request details are filled out, explaining the changes you made.
